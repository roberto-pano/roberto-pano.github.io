Creative Portion:
 
 
- Added clock to show user the current time
- Users can share events with other existing users

TA Feedback:

-2: Event cannot be added - tried adding under new and old user, did not show up under the specific day.

-3: Did not validate username in server - theoretically anyone can fake a fetch request and edit any event without being the owner.'

-1: Ease of use: All messages are console.log, meaning the user must open the console to figure out what is wrong.

-1 Ease of use: After editing events it is not updated automatically, requiring clicking away and back again.

-5: Creative feature: We are looking for 3 creative features here - 5 points each. You only have 2.

-3: Creative feature: Share event did not work - I tried sharing rob's 10/18/2022 event to Test, and it did not prompt me anything and did not show up in Test's calendar. 2 pts given for the button and UI field.

-5: Did not manage to find the clock. No element is displaying the current time.
